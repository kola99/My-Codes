Look for inconsistency: Ideally, the difference between any element and its index must be arr[0] for every element.
Find middle element and check if it’s consistent.
If middle element is consistent, then check if the difference between middle element and its next element is greater than 1 i.e. check if arr[mid + 1] – arr[mid] > 1
If yes, then arr[mid] + 1 is the missing element.
If not, then we have to scan the right half array from the middle element and jump to step-1.
If middle element is inconsistent, then check if the difference between middle element and its previous element is greater than 1 i.e. check if arr[mid] – arr[mid – 1] > 1
If yes, then arr[mid] – 1 is the missing element.
If not, then we have to scan the left half array from the middle element and jump to step-1.
