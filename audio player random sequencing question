There is a audio player given which picks up a random song from the playlist and plays it.The song should not be repeated until all songs are played atleast once.
The sequence number of the songs are given in an array.Design such audio player without using any extra space.

here the main thing is that randomistaion must be done with equal probabiliy to get selected to play...

so yha random function ko aise define krenge--

randomshuffle(int i,int j)//random shuffling from index i to j
{
if(i==j)return;
int k=Math.rand();
swapa[k]and a[i];
randomshuffle(i+1,j);
}

Now iske baad do a sequential playing of songs till u reach the end of the array;
