Approach one -if numbers are all positive then mul one list by -1 then search for negative number in it...
this fails for 0 case or if there are strings in linked list...
Approach 2-consider length of list 1 as n and list 2 as m then we take the diff of these length then traverse
that much in first list...after that start traversing in both list from that place till the pointer address becomes wsame that is p==q
