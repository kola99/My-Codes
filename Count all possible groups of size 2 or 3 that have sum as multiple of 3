Count all possible groups of size 2 or 3 that have sum as multiple of 3---\
use some modulus wala jugad---
find remainder of each element with 3


matlabd
 rem[0],rem[1],rem[2]
 
 then for 2 elements
 either both from rem[0]
 either one from rem[1]and one from rem[2]
 
 
 then for 3 elements
 
 --
all three from rem[0]
all three from rem[1]
one from each group
 ye sabse accha approach hai ...
