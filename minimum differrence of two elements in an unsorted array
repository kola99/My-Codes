Appraoch of nlog n is by sorting and picking up the middle elements

Appraoch of O(n) --
using frequencey array--
Make a frequency array add elements to them ---

after adding freq we just traverse the array to find the difference in the adjacent elements and then return the minimum of that also 0 must be returned in 
case of any element having frequency greater than 1
